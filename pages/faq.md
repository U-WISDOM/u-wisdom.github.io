### How long will my project take? Aka how much will it cost?

Every project is different; this is why we offer customized workflows tailored to your project. After your <a href="/contact">initial consultation</a>, we will provide a detailed timeline and budget for completion of your project. In most cases, this will be 50 or 100% FTE of one bioinformatician plus 5% FTE for project oversight by UWISDOM for a couple weeks or months. 

### How can I cite UWISDOM?

We ask that you cite UWISDOM in publications to aid in our efforts to obtain funding. Please include UWISDOM in the **acknowledgements** with: "We acknowledge support from the U of Washington Informatics, Systems immunology, and Data Omics in Medicine (UWISDOM) core."

### What about authorship?

If a UWISDOM bioinformatician contributes substantively to a publication, we ask that you include them as a co-author. Our bioinformaticians are predominately early career scientists who rely on their publication record for career advancement and growth. Authoship will be discussed in the initial consultation, though we realize things may change as the project progresses.

### Can departments or other UW entities buy time?

If you have a UW budget number, we can make it happen!

### Can non-UW groups work with UWISDOM?

Unfortunately, at this time, we are only able to work within the U of Washington system.
