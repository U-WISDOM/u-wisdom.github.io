There are many open-source resources in bioinformatics. Here, we highlight UWISDOM's contributions as well as outside resources we've learned from in the past. This is not an exhaustive list by any means, and we welcome recommendations sent to [uwisdom@uw.edu](mailto:wisdom@uw.edu)!

## UWISDOM

* [Workshops](https://bigslu.github.io/workshops/)
* [Tutorials](https://bigslu.github.io/tutorials/)
* Software
  * [SEAsnake](https://bigslu.github.io/SEAsnake/vignette/SEAsnake_vignette.html) for processing fastq sequences to counts data used in our workshops
  * [kimma](https://bigslu.github.io/kimma_vignette/) for flexible mixed effects models of omics data

## Beginner coders

* [The Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) for Unix, R, python, git, and more!
* BioInformatics Group at South Lake Union ([BIGslu](https://bigslu.github.io/workshops/)) for R and git
* [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/scn/title.html) for interactive R courses
* [EDUCE](https://educe-ubc.github.io/workshops/) at the U of British Columbia for R with a focus on microbiome data and statistics
* [Riffomonas](https://www.riffomonas.org/code_club/) Dr. Pat Schloss's coding club with open-source materials and recordings
* [R cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) also available in RStudio under Help > Cheatsheets

## RNA-seq analysis

* [SEAsnake](https://bigslu.github.io/SEAsnake/vignette/SEAsnake_vignette.html) for processing fastq sequences to counts data used in our workshops
* [kimma](https://bigslu.github.io/kimma_vignette/) for flexible mixed effects model design
* [limma](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/limma/inst/doc/usersguide.pdf) for linear modeling (Chapter 15: RNA-Seq Data)
    * [voom weights](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r29) for correcting for sample and gene quality
* [dream](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/variancePartition/inst/doc/dream.html) for paired sample designs

## Local groups and meetups
