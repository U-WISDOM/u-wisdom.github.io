## Letters of support

UWISDOM is happy to provide letters of support. Please request a letter from UWISDOM ( uwisdom@uw.edu ) and include the title of your proposal, a brief summary, PI name, and funding agency. Please allow at least 2 weeks to receive your letter.


## Grant consultation and writing

At this time, we do not have central funding to support grant writing, review, or consultation. We ask that our initial consultation meetings only be used for projects with active funding.
