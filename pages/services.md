UWISDOM provides bioinformatics services and resources to the U of Washington. We bring expertise in multi-omics, statistics, and machine learning to help you glean novel insights from your biological data. We offer assistance with experimental design, data analysis, and manuscript publication. Whether it is a one-time meeting or many years of collaboration, we are here for you! 

## <a href="/services/data-analysis">Data analysis</a>

From DNA to RNA to protein, our bioinformaticians have experience in many multi-omic data types. We provide customized analysis of your data including data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization. Learn more, <a href="/services/data-analysis">here</a>.

## <a href="/services/training">Training</a>

If you have researchers who want to learn how to analyze their own data, we offer one-on-one as well as small group training in omics analysis. Learn more, <a href="/services/training">here</a>.

## <a href="/services/grants">Grant support</a>

We have limited capacity to support grant writing or consultation. We do, however, provide letters of support. Learn more, <a href="/services/consult">here</a>.

## Costs

Every project is different. We provide a budget estimate following your initial project consultation. If a UWISDOM bioinformatician contributes substantially to a publication, we ask that you include them as a co-author.
