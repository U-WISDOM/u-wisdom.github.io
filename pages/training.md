## One-on-one mentoring

UWISDOM can provide one-on-one mentoring to help researchers in your group learn how to perform bioinformatic analyses themselves. This can be accomplished in on-going consultations or more hands-on with a UWISDOM bioinformatician leading the analysis. Please setup an <a href="/contact">initial consultation</a> to discuss options.

There are also many open-source resources for self-learning. Please see our <a href="/services/resources">resources</a> to learn more.

## Workshops

UWISDOM hosts hybrid, hands-on workshops in bioinformatics. You can find our past workshops <a href="https://bigslu.github.io/workshops/">on GitHub</a> and up-coming workshops below. If you would like to setup a workshop for your group or one with custom content, please contact us ( [uwisdom@uw.edu](mailto:wisdom@uw.edu) ).
