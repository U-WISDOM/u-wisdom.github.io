## Initial project consultation

All projects start with a **free project consultation**. This is a 1-hour meeting to gather information on your project and outline how U-WISDOM can help. Please reach out to Kim Dill-McFarland ( kadm[at]uw[.]edu ) and include <a href="/forms/UWISDOM_consult_form.pdf" download>this form</a> when scheduling your consultation.

If you just have some questions or want to learn more about U-WISDOM, please feel free to reach out as well!

## On-going consultation

We offer consultation at the pace that works for your project. This could be a one-time meeting to review a grant, manuscript, or experimental plan. Or on-going meetings working with us to craft your grant or proposal. 

## Letters of support

U-WISDOM is happy to provide letters of support. Please request a letter from Kim Dill-McFarland ( kadm[at]uw[.]edu ) and include the title of your proposal, a brief summary, PI name, and funding agency. Please allow at least 2 weeks to receive your letter.
