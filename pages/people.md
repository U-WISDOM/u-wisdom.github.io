      Senior bioinformatician<br>
      <a style="font-weight:normal" href="https://kdillmcfarland.github.io/">Personal website</a><br><br>
  
      Kim Dill-McFarland founded UWISDOM in 2023 in order to grow bioinformatic resources at UW. She is working toward her Project Management Certificate at UW and received her PhD in Microbiology from another UW (U of Wisconsin-Madison). Kim is currently a Senior Bioinformatician in the School of Medicine where she manages UWISDOM as well as a group of bioinformaticians working within individual labs. She has extensive 'omics experience including epigenetics, genetics, RNA, and protein modalities. She loves creating R packages and reproducible workflows, and you will most commonly find her coding with a cat in her lap. When not working, Kim can often be found building in Minecraft or working on massive puzzles that are too large for her coffee table.

      <h3>Dane Grosvenor, MSc</h3>
      Bioinformatician I<br><br>
  
      Dane Grosvenor is a Bioinformatician in the Altman Lab at the UW School of Medicine. Dane primarily works with bulk RNA-Seq transcriptomic data in R to analyze a variety of biological questions related to human immunology. Dane has a Master's degree in Bioinformatics from Northeastern University and utilizes his experience in computational biology, biomedical data science, and an evolutionary biology background to assist in numerous projects. He thoroughly enjoys working with biological data, being able to create useful figures to explain his results, and taking his new puppy on walks while his computational models run.

      Bioinformatician II<br><br>
  
      Madison Cox is a Bioinformatician working with the Altman and Hawn labs at UW. She received her PhD in Microbiology from the U of Wisconsin-Madison, where she explored the possibility of improving milk production through the dairy cow gut microbiome. Madison now leverages her coding expertise to investigate human responses to disease in including asthma and tuberculosis. She enjoys complex data sets and has particular experience in multi-omics integration and latent factor analyses. In their free-time, Madison and her dog Wisconsin (Wisco) like to play rigorous rounds of fetch and curl up on the couch with a good show.

      Bioinformatician II<br>
      <a style="font-weight:normal" href="https://rmsegnitz.wixsite.com/home">Personal website</a><br><br>
  
      Max Segnitz is a Bioinformatician in the Altman and Hawn labs in the School of Medicine, where he uses multi-omics data to explore human immune responses to allergy and infectious diseases. His research has focused primarily on genetic regulation of human susceptibility to _M. tuberculosis_ as well as gene interactions involved in response to biologic treatment of allergy and asthma. Secretly an ecologist, Max earned his PhD from Stanford in Ecology and Evolution working in the forests of Borneo, where he used field experimentation and meta-community sequencing to explore plant-fungal interactions and diversity in tropical forests. When he's not busy optimizing parallel computing or perfecting a new data visualization, you might find Max in the woodshop or baking a loaf of sourdough bread.
