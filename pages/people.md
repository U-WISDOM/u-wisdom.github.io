      <h3>Kim Dill-McFarland, PhD</h3>
      Senior bioinformatician<br><br>
  
      Kim Dill-McFarland founded UWISDOM in 2023 in order to grow bioinformatic resources at UW. She previously created the Bioinformatics Group at South Lake Union (BIGslu) where some of UWISDOM's ideas began. Kim is currently a Senior Bioinformatician in the School of Medicine where she manages UWISDOM as well as a group of bioinformaticians working within individual labs at UW. She has extensive 'omics experience including epigenetics, genetics, RNA, and protein modalities. She loves creating R packages and reproducible workflows, and you will most commonly find her coding with a cat in her lap.

      <h3>Dane Grosvenor, MSc</h3>
      Bioinformatician I<br><br>
  
      Dane Grosvenor is a current member of the Altman Lab at the UW School of Medicine. Dane primarily works with bulk RNA-Seq transcriptomic data in R to analyze a variety of biological questions related to human immunology. Dane has a Masters degree in Bioinformatics from Northeastern University and utilizes his experience in computational biology, biomedical data science, and an evolutionary biology background to assist in numerous projects. He thoroughly enjoys working with biological data, being able to create useful figures to explain his results, and taking his new puppy on walks while his computational models run.
