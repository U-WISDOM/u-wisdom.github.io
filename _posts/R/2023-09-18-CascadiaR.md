## What is Cascadia R Conf?

Cascadia R Conference is an R conference serving the Pacific Northwest (OR/WA/BC). This event is a place to come together around R and get together with like-minded people across the region. This conference first started in 2017 with the strong support of R-Ladies Portland and has since expanded across the region. We are excited to return to an in-person event this year and hope to see you there!
